I am Assistant Professor of **Data-Centric Design** with the [Department of Sustainable Design Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/about-ide/departments/design-engineering/) (SDE) of the [Faculty of Industrial Design Engineering](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ide/) (IDE) of the [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/) üßê.

My [research](/research) lies at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Data Science and Participatory Design. I hypothesise that the central use of **behavioural data** in Human-Centred Design can turn challenges and limitations of both fields into flourishing **ethical and collaborative opportunities**.
