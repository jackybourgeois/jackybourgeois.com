D-Code will bring 15 PhD students to work together in ProtoTeams on the Fundamentals of Design Competence for our Digital Future. This IDE-led Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN) will touch on governance, value, interactions and algorithms. On my side, I am impatient to get started collaborating with UmeÃ¥ on __'Designing alternatives for the Terms of Service (TOS)'__ (ESR 12) and __'Designing mechanisms for public deliberation on data use'__ (ESR 13).
