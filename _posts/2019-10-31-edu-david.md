In this thesis, guidelines are proposed for designing a Blockchain based bike-sharing service. These guidelines are based upon the design process of a circular bike-sharing service DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organisation) which was designed as a use-case for this project. This thesis also describes the design process of this DAO and what this use-case concept contains.
