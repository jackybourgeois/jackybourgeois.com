This year I had the honour to help out the curation and organisation of Up Close and Personal -- a Design United contribution to the Dutch Design Week. For the 2021 edition, we will talk about [Entangled Ecologies](https://2021.design-united.nl/day-1-entangled-ecologies/), [Connected Interactions](https://2021.design-united.nl/day-2-connected-interactions/), [Changin Things](https://2021.design-united.nl/day-3-changing-things/), [Embedded Designers](https://2021.design-united.nl/day-4-embedded-designers/) and [Evolving Methodologies](https://2021.design-united.nl/day-5-evolving-methodologies/).

Come visit us at the Klokgebouw in Eindhoven and watch the talkshows on the [website](https://2021.design-united.nl/)!
