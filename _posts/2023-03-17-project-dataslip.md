A few month ago Alejandra and I started prototyping the DataSlip, a ATM-like machine that asks you a few questions about the digital services you use and gives you a 'long' receipt capturing the amount of data you leave behind.

Yesterday we moved our prototype for the first time beyond TU Delft campus to showcase it in Utrecht for the SURF event [Your secrets are safe with us: Tooling for research with sensitive data](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda/your-secrets-are-safe-with-us-tooling-for-research-with-sensitive-data)
