The Internet of Things has become a key enabling technology for data-intensive research across universities and private organisations alike. However, the recent introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe has raised concerns that the GDPR might hamper data-intensive research. In this paper, we address the question of how to enable ethical and compliant research with personal IoT data in an academic environment. We identify three novel trust principles for GDPR compliant use of personal IoT data in science and research (private-by-default, analytics transparency and Accountable analytics) and propose an architecture for a trusted IoT research infrastructure.
