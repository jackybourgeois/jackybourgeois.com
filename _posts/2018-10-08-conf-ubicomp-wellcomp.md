This workshop paper contributed to WellComp, the First International Workshop on Computing for Well-Being in Conjunction with UbiComp 2018.

Improving people's well-being through relevant products and services is a designer task. They achieve this by combining innovative ideas with appropriate technologies. While the Internet of Things (IoT) brings vast opportunities in this regard, it significantly raises the rapid-prototyping complexity. In this paper, we look at the challenge of designing for wheelchair users' well-being. How do we empower designers to effectively envision relevant products and services to improve wheelchair user well-being? We propose the concept of Domain-Specific Design Platforms (DSDP) to help designers inform, rapid-prototype and evaluate their design concepts.
