This workshop paper contributed to the workshop IOT Horizons, a New Horizons for the IoT in Everyday Life: Proactive, Shared, Sustainable.

In this paper we raise the question of how to enable groups of individuals to collaboratively design, implement and maintain IoT-enabled sharing economy services. We argue that there is a need for HCl research to engage with the whole lifecycle of sharing services, from inception and design to operation and use. In particular, we motivate the need for an open design approach for IoT-enabled sharing services that fosters intelligibility, accountably and control with respect to the mechanisms and algorithms that govern a sharing service.
