Domestic energy generation such as through solar panels and wind turbines is considered an important piece in the puzzle of our future energy strategy. This research aims to explore the concept of domestic energy demand shifting through autonomous and engaging scheduling of energy loads. A mix of analysis, user-centric and design methodologies will be employed to help people understand how they can narrow the energy gap between domestic electricity generation and electricity consumption.
