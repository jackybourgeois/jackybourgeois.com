On April 8 from 10:00 to 12:00, students of the Master Elective 'Prototyping for and with the Internet of Things' (ID5412) will exhibit and demonstrate their work: 9 internet-connected wheelchairs with sensors, actuators and data processing components.

The purpose of this course is to get knowledge and skills on the development and use of prototypes for connected products.

During the course, students developed four iterations of a connected product per group, along with the following design brief:

>‘While the population of wheelchair users is growing worldwide, it becomes urgent to design supportive technologies that fit their needs. We aim to develop products for the improvement of the wheelchair users’ well-being. This design is a connected product that collects data from sensors, processes it in order to actuate user interactions embedded on the wheelchair.’
