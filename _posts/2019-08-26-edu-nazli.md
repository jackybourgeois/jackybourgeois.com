With the rise of remote working opportunities, the definition of office is changing and this is also affecting the way that we shape our offices. Nowadays, more and more companies are switching to the flexible workspace. This shift is redefining the relationships and the communication motives colleagues have with each other. The project explores how the hindered aspect of communication can be revived with triggers in order to help the employees form deeper relationships. This is done via an iterative design process. The end results are guidelines for designing triggers and a digital product that houses the communication triggers.
