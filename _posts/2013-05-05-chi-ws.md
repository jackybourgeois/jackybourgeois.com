This workshop paper is a contribution to the workshop __'Methods for Studying Technology in the Home'__.

We discuss our experience in applying a Technology Probe approach to the study of new concepts and technologies at home. We discuss benefits and challenges of using this methodology based on an experiment which aimed to bring solar panel energy feedback into everyday life.
