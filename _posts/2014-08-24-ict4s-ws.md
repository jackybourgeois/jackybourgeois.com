This workshop paper contributes to the workshop __'A social practice perspective on the smart grid'__.

This paper presents a novel data-driven method to investigate the interdependence between technology design and human energy practices. The method â€“ called Participatory Data â€“ makes use of fine-grained energy data collected via smart meters and smart plugs, and behaviour visualisation during home visits to spark self-reflection among householders.
