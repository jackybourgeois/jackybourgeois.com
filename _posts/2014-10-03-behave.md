Emerging energy technologies,such as smart meters and solar photovoltaic systems (solar PV),are changing our relationship to energy. There isincreasing evidence that households with solar PV  on  their  roof  tend  naturally  to  shift  theirenergyconsumption in time to match their local generation, but whatdo people actually do to achieve thisand how ICT can support them to optimize their consumption? In this paper we present a year-long user study to understand social practices around laundry routines and local energy generation. We highlight four challenges for the next generation of home energy management systems.
