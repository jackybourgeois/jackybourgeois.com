Domestic energy generation using solar panels and heat pumps has become a feasible
option for most homeowners, yet lack of ICT solutions for microgeneration means that user
understanding of their own domestic energy is poor. In this paper, we explore the design of
in-home information interfaces for future domestic energy microgeneration services. We
present concrete design proposals and report insights from a wizard-of-Oz field trial.
