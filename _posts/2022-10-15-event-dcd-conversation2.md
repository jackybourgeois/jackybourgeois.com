Sandy Gould is a Senior Lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University. One aspect of Sandyâ€™s research focuses on the ways that computing technology is affecting how we work and what it means to work. In particular, he has been investigating how peopleâ€™s work is tracked by digital technology (explicitly and implicitly) as they work, and how measures of work are constituted in workplaces.
