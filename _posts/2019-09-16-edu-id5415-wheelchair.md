On Nov 4 from 11:00 to 14:00, students of the Master Elective 'Prototyping Connected Products' (ID5415) will exhibit and demonstrate their work: 8 internet-connected wheelchairs with sensors, actuators and data processing components.

In this course, students develop their ability to build and use functional prototypes as part of their design process. They gain this prototyping experience through the guided development of a connected wheelchair. In teams of three, they build and use several iterations of this prototype with a strong focus on the technology and the functional implementation. They rely on a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino to sense user behaviours and control interactive actuators via Python and Arduino code. Their prototype helps them gain an understanding of the technologies through tests and data exploration.

This course was a pilot as part of our [Erasmus+ IoT Rapid-Proto Labs project](/posts/iotprotolabs/), featured as the [Internet-Connected Wheelchair](https://www.rapidprotolabs.eu/projects/internet-connected-wheelchair/).

All the material for this course is open-source and available on the [dedicated website](https://id5415.datacentricdesign.org)
