Behavioral treatment shows long-term success among children with AD(H)D, but is often expensive and hard to bring into practice. Flowy is a wristband that supports behavioral interventions by giving rhythmic vibrations as reminders for behavioral change.Rhythmic vibrations on the wrist have shown to have a calming effect, and can alert users to think of behavioral interventions. Different vibration patterns can foster self-regulating thoughts such as asking “Am I behaving as I intended to do?” or “Am I still focused?”. This increases the self-regulating ability of a child during individual tasks at school.Flowy is designed like a buddy for children with AD(H)D. It is like a helping friend that motivates them to study longer. It also gives the child ownership of self-regulation, because it let children create own vibration patterns for activities. This is realized by providing an app that brings the ‘buddy’ alive, explains self- regulation techniques and involves parents to monitor the process to create a positive reinforcement within the family.
