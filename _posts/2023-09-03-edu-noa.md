Earlier this week, I had the pleasure to join Nicole van Nes and Jered Vroon on the graduation committee of [Noa Knorringa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noa-knorringa) for her Master thesis, '
Designing predictable behaviour for autonomous delivery vehicles'. She conducted an impressive series of experiements to understand how people communicate intentions in the street and how it could shape the behaviour of last-mile delivery robots.
