Where do we go? What do we eat? How do we exercise, sleep and feel? Through mobile apps and sensors, the Internet of Things has empowered everyone to capture detailed pictures of their life. The highly dynamic nature of this data makes it deeply intertwined with people, their behavior, and their experiences: an excellent material for subjective inquiry. Today I had the opportunity to talk at DRIVE about Data-Centric Design and Data Donation. Of course. I started with the DataSlip, the  ATM-like prototype confronting us with the vast data traces we leave behind build by Alejandra Gomez Ortega. Then, I discussed how behavioral data enables new ways to connect and engage with people, offers tools for reflection to enrich the design process, and helps designers surface possibilities and blind spots of data together with the people who generate it.
