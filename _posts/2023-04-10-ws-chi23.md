I'm looking forward to attending the CHI '23 workshop on Data as a Material for Design and mingling with the amazing organization team! I will bring to the table some of the case studies we explored on the topic of Data-Centric Design, particularly the excellent work from Akari Takada as part of her Master thesis.
