## Context

Data donation aims at collecting personal data for a design purpose at scale. It enables responsible access to personal data through an active engagement of the data subjects in donating data.

However, this mechanism potentially produces highly dynamic datasets. For example, donors can grant and revoke their donation, proactively give data that is not yet collected, or filter data points out of their donation.

How can stakeholders of a data donation campaign (e.g. designers, researchers, ethics commitee) remain informed about the dataset they have at hand?

This challenge relates to longitudinal studies and the issue of participants compliance.

- How do we monitor a data donation campaign?
- How does it relate or contrast with a longitudinal study?

## Project

In this project, we propose developing and testing a web-based application to monitor a data donation campaign. The project will start from insights from longitudinal studies to develop more specific requirements for data donation. It will highlight the key difference and upcoming challenges.

## Student Profile

You are curious and eager to develop open-source tools for data management and visualisation. You feel comfortable developing with web technologies such as Angular and websockets, connecting to existing REST APIs in a containerised environment.

## Outcome and Evaluation

You are expected to design, implement and evaluate a web-based data donation dashboard. The evaluation will take place in the context of a data donation campaign.
