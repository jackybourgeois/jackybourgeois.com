People have been using the digital technology domain to seek solutions to combat neglected tropical diseases. Aside from feasibility and effectiveness, WHO has pointed out the importance of having an overview that pinpoints the lacking infrastructure for scaling up and sustaining digital proposals. This research demystifies the untapped digital data in combating neglected tropical disease and aims to provide an overview for people to take strategic action. Who are all the stakeholders in this elimination procedure? What are the needed data to tackle this disease? How can digital innovation best interfere with the current disease elimination flow? The researcher has chosen the content of Kenya and the neglected disease of Schistosomiasis as the subject. Building on numerous expert interviews and the literature review, the footprint of disease combating related data has been systematically analyzed from different angles. With a holistic view, this series of analyses poses as a step-by-step guide for the strategic planning of complicated neglected disease or health-related issue in low-resource setting countries. An example of a new Schistosomiasis diagnostic device, SODOS, is presented at the end to showcase the effectiveness of the analyzing approach.
