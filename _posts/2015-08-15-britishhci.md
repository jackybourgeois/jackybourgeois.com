This workshop paper contributed to the workshop 'Sustainable HCI in the UK'.

The home energy environment, as part of the smart grid implementation, is starting a deep mutation: (i) householders have started generating their own electricity, (ii) new high electrical demand appliances have appeared such as heat pumps and electric vehicles, significantly increasing consumption, and (iii) domestic electricity storage is now commercially available. These transformations will result in both the challenge of increasing the complexity and the opportunity of closing the gap between producer and consumer â€“ thus making energy more tangible for householders.
