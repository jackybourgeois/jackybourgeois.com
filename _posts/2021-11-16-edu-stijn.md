Dutch primary school teachers are strapped for time currently, and this is impeding the adoption of innovation. This is also a problem for Faqta, who are trying to sell their innovative teaching method. To convince teachers to learn, several theories and strategies are explored in this report, and how they can be applied on a digital video learning platform, the Faqta Academy, to answer the question “How can primary school teachers be inspired & motivated to learn & apply new educational methods with the Faqta Academy?”. The three most effective strategies to convince and captivate teachers are Microlearning, Self-determination Theory and Gamification. Microlearning lowers the bar of entry, while gamification keeps the attention over a longer period of time. Application of self-determination theory makes sure that teachers can actually internalize the motivation to apply the learnt material, by promoting Autonomy, Competence and Relatedness.This report explores how to apply these to Faqta’s Academy by introducing several design strategies in a framework for motivation, and applies them to the Academy through a workflow.
