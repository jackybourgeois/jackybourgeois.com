summary: |
  In this episode, we have a Data-Centric Design conversation with Audrey Desjardins on Data Imagineries. Audrey is associate professor at the University of Washington and director of Studio Tilt. She is well-known in the HCI community, particularly in the context of data and the home environment. I am inspired by her work combining design fiction and autoethnographic studies with data prototyping.
  
  Preparing this conversation, I focused on her recent CHI paper ‘On the Making of Alternative Data Encounters: The Odd Interpreters’, a paper she wrote with Jena McWhirter, Justin Petelka, Chandler Simon, Yuna Shin, Ruby K Peven, and Philbert Widjaja. We touch on the role of designers and the urgent need for imaginaries when designing with data.
