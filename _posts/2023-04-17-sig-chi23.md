We are working hard for the Special Interest Group on Data as Human-Centred Design Material! Join us at **CHI '23, on April 26th from 11:10 to 12:35**, for this exciting discussion! Check out the [CHI program](https://programs.sigchi.org/chi/2023/program/content/99310).

## What will we discuss?

ðŸ‘‰ **Responsibility, Participation, and Reciprocity** - What is beyond data privacy and open data? How can data-centric fit and challenge existing data protection regulations and ethical frameworks in practice? What methods lead to a fair exchange of values and robust insights instead of research driven by data consumption? To what extent do these approaches reinforce or mitigate existing inequalities?

ðŸ‘‰ **Tools and Competencies** - What is data infrastructure for design? What are data design patterns for human-centred research? How to assess data quality? How to navigate regulatorily body processes for exploratory work with personal data? What is human-centred data literacy for design? How do we teach data as material for design? What about data-enabled, data-centric, data-driven, data-informed, data-inspired, and data-aware?

ðŸ‘‰ **Context and Expression** - In which application domain can we find exemplars of data as human-centred design material? Where do we miss them? What are ways to express data as part of the human-centred design processes? How data representations influence the design (processes) and stakeholder interactions. And how can the various data modalities and materiality support fair representation and participation with data?
