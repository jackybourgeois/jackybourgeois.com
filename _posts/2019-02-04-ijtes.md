One promising way to cope with changing requirements from the labor market in the domain of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), but also  to  keep  the  field  up  to  date,  to  start  innovations  and  to  advance  the  STEM domain as such is the use of student labs. In these labs, students work together in small  groups  imitating  professional  practice  of  design  and  technology  workers. More insights are needed in what competences student labs in the STEM domain address  and  what  the  implications  would  be  for  the  design  of  student  labs.  A review of empirical studies on student labs and additional literature indicate that five  generic  competences  are  addressed  in  most  student  labs:  Collaboration, communication,  problem  solving,  critical  thinking,  and  creativity.  In  order  to effectively  enhanced  these  competences,  student  labs  should  be  designed  as authentic  productive  learning  environments  based  on  three  design  principles:  1) Realistic, complex task situations, 2) Multidisciplinarity,  and 3) Social interaction. IoT Rapid Proto Labs are examples of such a  student labs, in which cross-border multidisciplinary teams of students, teachers (coaches), and practitioners  jointly  develop  solutions  to  challenging  IoT  applications  (Internet-connected  objects),  add  value  for  enterprises,  and  strengthen  the  employability, creativity and career prospects of students.
