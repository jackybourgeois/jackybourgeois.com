The goal of this thesis was to design a way for Ford to provide users more value during long-distance Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) trips. Users tend to buy their vehicle for the 95th percentile of use-cases. In the Netherlands, the average amount of km driven per day is 32 km, which is easily covered by any BEV currently on the market, without the need for charging during these trips. This means long-distance trips are the 95th percentile of use.

For mass-market BEV adoption, the Early Majority needs to be attracted. Within the Early Majority consumer segment, there are certain target groups that are most likely to adopt BEV driving. These are the potential BEV drivers and were identified through literature research. However, these target groups are not yet investing in BEVs due to the following adoption barriers that play a role in long-distance BEV trips: charging time, charging infrastructure and range. Through qualitative research such as interviews, observations and netnography, the reasons behind these adoption barriers were researched.

A solution has been created that mitigates these adoption barriers. The solution is a digital, data-driven, in-vehicle service system. The technical working principles of the service were designed with a new method that has been created along with the concept development, called Data Journey Mapping. This Data Journey Map shows how the different components within the data ecosystem communicate and what data they transmit. Together with Ford engineers, the working principles of the service system have been validated.

The solution has been validated with potential BEV drivers and current BEV drivers. Both groups stated the solution has significant added value. Potential BEV drivers stated that this solution would pull them toward investing in BEVs. Current BEV drivers stated that this solution could be decisive when comparing BEVs.

By launching this service system, adoption barriers of Potential BEV drivers are mitigated. This could result in an acceleration of BEV adoption in the Early Majority consumer segment, which is needed for the mass-market adoption of BEVs.
