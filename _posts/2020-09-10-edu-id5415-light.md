In this course, students develop their ability to build and use functional prototypes as part of their design process. They gain this prototyping experience through the guided development of a connected light product. In teams of three, they build and use several iterations of this product with a strong focus on the technology and the functional implementation. They rely on a Raspberry Pi â€“ small computer â€“ to sense contextual changes and control connected light bulbs via Python code. Their prototype helps them gain an understanding of the technologies through tests and data exploration.
