This workshop paper contributed to the UbiComp '21 workshop SensiBlend, 'Sensing Blended Experiencesin Professional and Social Contexts'.

In-the-wild research allows the HCI community to gain insights into personal behaviour and characteristics. For designers and researchers, this means having access to rich spatiotemporal insights reflecting userâ€™s characteristics, behaviours, and needs. However, designerly contexts require contextualized and meaningful data, and collecting it in-the-wild involves a great effort. In addition, ethical implications need to be considered. In this paper, we propose designerly data donation, a participatory approach for data collection in-the-wild, as an effective and ethical way to enable data-centric design processes. We present the potential benefits of designerly data donation around three axes: value gain, data contextualization, and roles and relationships. And we introduce the challenges of designerly data donation at the intersection of HCI, UbiComp, and design.
