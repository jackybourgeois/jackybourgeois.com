The Dutch Design Week is around the corner, and we're eager to discuss Neo Craftsmanship with you. Join us next week, Oct 28, from 15:00 to 18:00 in Design Unitedâ€™s Design Research Programme Transitions in Microlab, Strijp S Eindhoven, during the DDW2022!

We will have an engaging conversation with tangible examples of materials, methods, and machines that shape tomorrow's design craftsmanship.

What's new? What are the challenges emerging from these crafts for designers? How does it change, strengthen or weaken the role of designers? How can we prepare future designers for this craft?
What does it mean to â€˜craftâ€™ when physical and digital boundaries vanish?
